                            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing

                            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
